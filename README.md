- **Function Code:**
  ```solidity
  function executeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
      uint256 balanceFrom = balanceOf(from);
      uint256 balanceTo = balanceOf(to);
      require(balanceFrom >= amount, "insufficient balance");

      uint256 allowed = allowance[from][msg.sender];
      if (msg.sender != from && allowed != type(uint256).max) {
          require(allowed >= amount, "insufficient allowance");
          allowance[from][msg.sender] = allowed - amount;
      }

      totalSupply -= amount;
      balanceOf[from] = balanceFrom - amount;
      unchecked {
          balanceOf[to] = balanceTo + amount;
      }

      if (totalSupply > 0) {
          // only call transfer hook if not withdrawing full amount
          (bool success, bytes memory data) = to.call(
              abi.encodeWithSelector(OnTransferReceived.onTransferReceived.selector, msg.sender, from, amount, "")
          );
          if (success && data.length > 0) {
              require(abi.decode(data, (bytes4)) == OnTransferReceived.onTransferReceived.selector, "invalid onTransferReceived() selector");
          }
      }
      emit Transfer(from, to, amount);
  }
  ```
- **Used Encoding/Decoding or Call Method:** `abi.encodeWithSelector`

### Explanation
- **Purpose:** 
  The `executeTransferFrom` function is an internal function that executes the core logic for transferring tokens from one address to another within the cUSDCv3 token contract. It performs balance updates, checks allowances, and implements a transfer hook mechanism to enable custom actions upon token transfer.

- **Detailed Usage:**
  - **Balance and Allowance Checks:** 
    The function begins by checking the sender's balance to ensure they have enough tokens to transfer. It also verifies if the sender has sufficient allowance if they are not the caller (`msg.sender`).
  - **Allowance Adjustment:** 
    If the allowance is not the maximum possible value (`type(uint256).max`), it decreases the allowance by the transfer amount.
  - **Balance Update:** 
    It updates the total supply and the balances of the sender and recipient.
  - **Transfer Hook:** 
    If the total supply is greater than zero after the transfer (indicating not all tokens were withdrawn), the function calls the `onTransferReceived` function on the recipient's address using `abi.encodeWithSelector`. This constructs the call data in a standardized, gas-efficient way.
    - **Success and Selector Check:** 
      The function checks if the call was successful and if the returned data matches the expected selector, ensuring the integrity of the hook call.
  - **Event Emission:** 
    The function emits a `Transfer` event to signal the completion of the transfer.

- **Impact:**
  1. **Security and Efficiency:** 
     Ensures secure token transfers by verifying balances and allowances, which is crucial for the token's integrity.
  2. **Interoperability:** 
     The transfer hook mechanism enhances interoperability with other smart contracts, allowing recipients to implement custom logic upon receiving tokens.
  3. **Gas Efficiency:** 
     By using `abi.encodeWithSelector` and including conditions to avoid unnecessary calls, the function optimizes gas usage.
  4. **Security and Reliability:** 
     Comprehensive checks and balances (e.g., balance and allowance checks, hook response validation) increase the security and reliability of the token contract.
  5. **DeFi Interactions:** 
     Supports complex DeFi interactions by enabling automated actions or integrations with other protocols upon token transfer.

This function is a crucial component that ensures the cUSDCv3 token operates securely and efficiently within the Compound III protocol and the broader DeFi ecosystem.
